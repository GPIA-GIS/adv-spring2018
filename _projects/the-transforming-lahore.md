The project is a series of mapping initiatives designed to show the way Lahore is transforming alongside the capital that is flowing in the city through the global investments like CPEC. The following maps show the argument made on the transformation spread because of these infrastructural projects.

LAHORE'S URBAN EXPANSION
Lahore has been expanding its urban boundaries exponentially as shown in the map. The Urban boundary of Lahore in 2013 was 37,142 hectares, increasing at an average annual rate of 3.6% since 2000 and 3% since 1991, moving from a south eastern spread towards a circular outward growth today.

POPULATION INDEX OF LAHORE
The population of Lahore is concetrated in the central strips of the Old city as shown in the map. The Population of Lahore today is 11.13 million with an increasing growth rate. The population density is the highest in the oldest parts of the city as shown.

THE DEVELOPMENT CONCENTRATIONS AND MOVEMENTS
This map helps trace the growth of infrastructure and capital in Lahore. The trend of the concentrations of capital, health care facilities, infrastructure including roads and metro lines all coincides around the central localities of the city center. The map defines these development patterns through the time.

THE ANALYSIS OF THE SHADOWS OF DEVELOPMENT
The map concludes the dichotomies in the development and capital movement in the city of Lahore. The analysis of the health facilities concentrations and the population densities suggests the areas of urban problematics in Lahore. The metro lines add to these areas of conflicting realities that shape the premise of the site of selection, Anarkali.

REPORTED INCIDENTS
The map is created by the incidents of destruction reported by the development projects in Lahore.The map is created as an ongoing collection of reports from the citizens of Lahore. The collective data formulates this map and updates every hour.

The last mapping is linked to google entry document to allow people to report evictions, destructions, policing etc. This conclusive discussion is based on the premise laid out in the discourse of Lahore. Anarkali is concluded to be the one of the most critical position due to the shadowing of the development in Lahore. 
The process of the project is taken in a similar way of investigation and narrative traced through the data collection in lahore.
