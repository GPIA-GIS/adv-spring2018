Explore San Antonio's Parcels reveals land use, parcel characteristics, and current development trends in and around downtown San Antonio. Using 2017 parcel data from the Bexar County Appraisers Office, the primary map allows users to sort downtown parcels by their city-designated land use and learn about their value, year of construction, and name of the business or organization (if applicable) ocuppying the lot. ![]({{ page.img-folder }}XPkkOwr.png)

This map is contextualized with current development trends in San Antonio, and makes connections between current economic growth agendas and neighborhoods identified by the National Association of Community Asset Builders as being the most vulnerable to displacement in the city. ![]({{ page.img-folder }}bKb0oit.png) ![]({{ page.img-folder }}C20Ihhv.jpg)
